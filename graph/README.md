This is examle of my own graph "library"
==========

* __It is not finised yet !!!!!__

* __Actual status:__ creation of figure plot, axis and lines work. Adding new data
                 to existing ones work, setting new line data also work. __But only
                 graph is implemented also adding new axis is not tested.__

* __TODO:__ set function for titles, axis range and so on is still missing.
  1. check scenario when fix_lines is set on TRUE->it doesnt work well
  2. create function for setting fix axis range.
  3. create "set" function for others axis, line , plot and figure properties
  4. add other graph types
